# Overview

The purpose of writing this software is to demonstrate my knowledge and proficiency in the C++ language, particularly in object-oriented programming. By building a functional game, I can showcase my ability to use classes, objects, and member functions to model real-world scenarios.

This is a C++ program that simulates a game of blackjack, which is a popular card game played in casinos. The program implements several classes to represent the components of the game, such as the deck of cards, player's hand, and dealer's hand.

# Development Environment

Compiler: C++ code needs to be compiled to run the program. The program uses the following standard libraries provided by C++:
   - iostream: used for input/output operations
   - vector: used to create a container for cards
   - string: used to store string values of card suits and ranks
   - cstdlib: used for rand() and srand() functions to generate random numbers
   - ctime: used to get the current time to seed the random number generator.

# Future Work

- Add error handling for user input, such as checking if the input is valid and clearing the input buffer if necessary.
- Use templates to make the code more generic and reusable.
- Use exceptions to handle errors and propagate them to higher-level functions.
